## How do I get started?

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher) & npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/310assignment/guess-the-song
   cd guess-the-song
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create `.env` files in both `backend` directory and root directory of the project

   **server/.env:**

   ```env
   PORT=8080
   CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=30
   ```

   **root/.env:**

   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080/"
   ```

### Running Locally

1. **Start the backend server**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend (in another terminal)**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
  
### Running Multiplayer Mode

**⚠️ Important Note:** This multiplayer mode utilizes your IP address and only works if all users are connected to the same WiFi network. This is not a secure connection and should only be used in trusted environments.

1. **As Host, Identify your IP Address**
    On MacOs, run: `ifconfig` in terminal.
    On Windows, run: `ipconfig` in terminal.
    Obtain your IP address, it should resemble: `inet 172.23.26.228`
    In the following steps your IP address will be reffered to as "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS"

2. **Configure your URL**
   Your URL will be:
   `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080`

3. **Start the backend server**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Start the frontend (in another terminal)**

  For MacOs users:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   export VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
   export VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
   npm run dev
   ```
  For Windows users:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   set VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
   set VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
   npm run dev
   ```
  *Note: You can check to see whether these have been set using these commands:
  ```bash
  echo $VITE_API_BASE_URL
  echo $VITE_SOCKET_URL
  ```

  In your front end terminal you should see the appropriate links eg
  ```bash
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://172.23.38.47:5173/
  ```

5. **Playing the Game**
  You can play on either the local URL or the Network URL
  When asking other players to join, refer them to the Network Link.
