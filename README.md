## How do I get started?

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher) & npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/310assignment/guess-the-song
   cd guess-the-song
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm install react-use
   npm install react-confetti
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create `.env` files in both `backend` directory and root directory of the project

   **server/.env:**

   ```env
   PORT=8080
   CACHE_TTL_MINUTES=30
   ```

   **root/.env:**

   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080/"
   ```

### Running Locally

1. **Start the backend server**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend (in another terminal)**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Running Multiplayer Mode

**⚠️ Important Note:** This multiplayer mode utilizes your IP address and only works if all users are connected to the same WiFi network. This is not a secure connection and should only be used in trusted environments.

1. **As Host, Identify your IP Address**
   
    On MacOs, run: `ifconfig` in terminal. <br>
    On Windows, run: `ipconfig` in terminal. <br>
    Obtain your IP address, it should resemble: `inet 172.23.26.228`<br>
    In the following steps your IP address will be reffered to as "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS"

3. **Configure your URL**
   
   Your URL will be: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080`

5. **Start the Backend server**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Start the Frontend (in another terminal)**

     For MacOs users:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      export VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
      export VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
      npm run dev
      ```
     For Windows users:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      set VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
      set VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080
      npm run dev
      ```
     *Note: You can check to see whether these have been set using these commands:
     ```bash
     echo $VITE_API_BASE_URL
     echo $VITE_SOCKET_URL
     ```
   
     In your Frontend terminal you should see the appropriate links eg.
     ```bash
     ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
     ➜  Network: http://172.23.38.47:5173/
     ```

5. **Playing the Game**
   
     You can play on either the local URL or the Network URL. <br>
     When asking other players to join, refer them to the Network Link.
